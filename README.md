# VsServerConsoleThingy

Info:

This is a little project I decided to make bc i was dissatisfied by the lack of a proper server console for Vintage Story, so i made my own, currently only for win64 but will see about making it work on linux, tell me if you have any issues and I will try to fix them

Installation:
Install the zip folder to your vintagestorydata/mods folder and unzip it, then make a shortcut to the exe and that's all there is to it, do not remove the exe file from the folder
Features:

1: Server Input field for any commands you may need to send
2: Start/Stop Server buttons for quickly starting and stopping your server(oh and btw the server starts automatically when you launch the manager)
3: Richtext checkbox, right now the console defaults to a normal textbox because I couldn't get the richtext one to auto-scroll, but I prefer the look of the richtext box so I left the option to use it in
4: Saving checkbox, this is for if you are like me and have anxiety, sends the /autosavenow command every time the manager closes the server
5: Automatic server restart, does exactly what it says, restarts the server automatically on a daily or weekly basis, times can be configured, have not tested the weekly restart in-depth
6:Announcement maker, requires my Announcer mod to use(but the mod does not rely on this manager), allows to you send commands/announcements to the server at set times daily
7:Players list, will automatically display all players in-game
8:Whitelist field, type a player name in and it will send the /whitelist comamnd with that player's name in the console
9: exactly the same as 8 but for the /ban command, and you must provide a duration and reason as well
